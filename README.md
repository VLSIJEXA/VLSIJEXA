# VLSIJEXA

Hi there 👋

Welcome to the VLSIJEXA project! This repository is dedicated to learning and exploring Hardware Description Languages (HDL) and their applications in VLSI (Very Large Scale Integration) design. 

🌱 I’m currently learning HDL, focusing on building efficient digital systems and understanding the principles behind VLSI design. This repository will contain various exercises, projects, and resources as I continue to expand my knowledge in the field.

## 📚 Current Focus:
- Exploring VHDL/Verilog for designing digital circuits
- Implementing testbenches and simulations
- Learning about synthesis and optimization in VLSI

## 🚀 Getting Started
To get started with the project, clone this repository and explore the various directories for HDL code and documentation.

git clone https://github.com/VLSIJEXA/Basic-Verilog.git

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- C/Verilog/HDL
- Xilinx / Vivado 
- Digital Circuit Design
